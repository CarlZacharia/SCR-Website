She has approximately $400 - 500,000 in assets including a house in Brookline section of Pittsburgh. Her husband was a Korean Vet.\n\nHeather's Notes Mtg 03\/27\/2013:\nHave not signed on yet. Son, Dan, said he spoke to you in the past. Marilyn is 76 and currently at The Pines of Mt. Lebanon. Has been there since Feb 2010. Initially husband was with her but he has since passed away. Physically she is quite good however her dementia is progressing. She has a tendency to attach herself to one individual and wants to be with that person all the time. Currently it is a man named Bill. Unfortunately, he is leaving the facility. She follows him and becomes agitated when he is not around. She has become disruptive in the dining room mostly, but also does not participate in as many activities unless he is there. Over stimulation seems to be an issue. She has also begun to have some incontinence issues. The Pines staff has discussed moving her to their memory care unit. Dan is hesitant and unsure of what he wanted to do. He felt that this may not be necessary. \n\nI met with Dan today to educate him on the disease process. Looking at the stages of dementia in print, solidified for him, that mom was in fact in the moderate stage. It just so happened that the CRNP, Gwen and the exec director, Gary were both available to talk with us. They expressed their concerns and they all seem valid. They are willing to take her to the memory unit a couple times for activities and to get her acclimated before making the final move. They are also willing to send staff that she trusts over to memory care as she transitions. \n\nI met Marilyn as well. Very pleasant but was not able to answer many of my questions. We did connect on both being Lebanese women :)\n\nAfter speaking with Dan and trying to allay any fears he has, he admitted to being scared that this is the \"beginning of the end\" for mom. He feels like he has so much going on in his personal life as well as with mom. We discussed that mom may become less agitated (once she adapts) which would in turn reduce his anxieties about how she is doing when he is not around. He really wants to think more about WHEN to make this transition. I think he now understands that is needs to happen at some point. The Pines have not given him a time table or an ultimatum, they just want the lines of communication open and for him to begin to think about making the change. \n\n\n","actions":null,"postmtgnotes":"Met with Dan.

After she left he went down hill quickly and neighbors and friends alerted her. Dad owns his home, has IRA's, and savings. They are in the process of putting the house up for sale. She will email the SEL form to you as well as copies of all the documents Will, POA, and Living Will.

He needs about $3,700 a month in income to cover his needs.  Right now he has enough money, including the house, for about 6 years expending $5,000 a month and getting $1300 ($300,000 \/ $3,700 * 12)\n\nIf he was a Vet during Korea or WWII or Vietnam, we could change all of that, double it to 12 years before exhaustion.  He could get $1700 a month from the VA, if he qualifies.\n\nWe have two plans for you to consider, one is $7,200 and that would coverall of the legal and financial needs planning for your father to get him VA benefits.  The second is $12,000 and that covers everything the first one does as well as the services of our elder care coordinator.  She would be your eyes and ears up here.  We have two, Rowena and Heather.

My Mom lives in North Huntingdon and is 79 and not doing well.  She has dementia and has a difficult time keeping weight on.  She lives with her sister who is 78 and takes care of her, and my brother who helps out.  Her financial situation is not good.  Her home which they have lived in for 50 years has a mortgage on it that they took out 10 years ago one month before my father passed.  Income comes from social security for my mom and aunt and the little money my brother makes.  I live in Colorado so I am unable to visit often.  I would like to understand options if at some point my mom requires a nursing home.  I also worry about the living situation for my aunt and brother once my mom passes.
